**Score Lookup**

This project started as a small, static web application built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has been migrated to a Next.js app; the UI and data remain static (served from `public/data/`), but the app now runs as a Next.js application using React components (`app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`).

**Made with AI through human collaboration**

Parts of this project were authored with assistance from AI and reviewed, curated, and integrated by humans. The human contributors retain authorship and responsibility for the final content and behavior of the project.

**Quick Start**

- Run the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- The CLI scripts are defined in `package.json` (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`). If you prefer the standalone static experience you can still open `public/index.html` directly or serve `public/` as a static site.

**Status & Notes**

- The app has been migrated to Next.js and now runs as a React-based Next app. The dataset remains static and is served from `public/data/`.
- If you want me to remove legacy Next scaffold files or tidy `package.json` (e.g., remove dependencies) I can do that as a follow-up.

**Contributing**

Contributions are welcome. By contributing you agree to license your changes under GPLv3+ as well. See `LICENSE` for details.
